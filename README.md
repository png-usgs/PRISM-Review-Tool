PRISM Review Tool

The PRISM Review Tool (PRT) is a desktop application used for performing manual review, 
editing, and processing of COSMOS datasets. Multiple viewers and editors allow for
handling both seismic and spectral trace data. Trace editing is performed using the
trace's underlying V1 or V2 dataset. Committing trace editing changes will generate 
new V2 and V3 datasets. The tool also enables the use of templates in order to
sort and display trace data associated with channels for a specific station and a
specific time period or epoch. The tool is user configurable with the user preferences
persisted. 

PRT is platform-independent, coded in Java using the NetBeans IDE (version 8.2), and 
open-source. To support use by earthquake engineers and scientists, PRT is easy to install 
and runs on common operating systems such as Linux, OS X and Windows. The source code contains 
some additional NetBeans files to facilitate building code outside of an IDE or to bring the 
code into NetBeans.
